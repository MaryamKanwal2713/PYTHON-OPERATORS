*Python Operators*

This repository contains a Python code that demonstrates the use of various operators in Python, including:

*Arithmetic Operators*
- Addition: Adds two numbers together.
- Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.
- Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers together.
- Division: Divides one number by another.
- Modulus: Returns the remainder of a division operation.
- Exponentiation: Raises a number to a power.
- Floor Division: Returns the largest whole number after division.

*Assignment Operators*
- Assignment: Assigns a value to a variable.
- Addition Assignment: Adds a value to a variable and assigns the result.
- Subtraction Assignment: Subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result.
- Multiplication Assignment: Multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result.
- Division Assignment: Divides a variable by a value and assigns the result.
- Floor Division Assignment: Performs floor division on a variable and assigns the result.
- Exponentiation Assignment: Raises a variable to a power and assigns the result.
- Bitwise AND Assignment: Performs a bitwise AND operation on a variable and assigns the result.
- Bitwise OR Assignment: Performs a bitwise OR operation on a variable and assigns the result.
- Bitwise XOR Assignment: Performs a bitwise XOR operation on a variable and assigns the result.
- Right Shift Assignment: Shifts the bits of a variable to the right and assigns the result.
- Left Shift Assignment: Shifts the bits of a variable to the left and assigns the result.

*Comparison Operators*
- Equal To: Checks if two values are equal.
- Not Equal To: Checks if two values are not equal.
- Greater Than: Checks if one value is greater than another.
- Less Than: Checks if one value is less than another.
- Greater Than or Equal To: Checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.
- Less Than or Equal To: Checks if one value is less than or equal to another.

*Logical Operators*
- AND: Checks if both conditions are true.
- OR: Checks if at least one condition is true.
- NOT: Reverses the result of a condition.

*Identity Operators*
- IS: Checks if both variables refer to the same object.
- IS NOT: Checks if both variables do not refer to the same object.

*Membership Operators*
- IN: Checks if a value is present in a sequence.
- NOT IN: Checks if a value is not present in a sequence.

*Bitwise Operators*
- Bitwise AND: Performs a bitwise AND operation on two values.
- Bitwise OR: Performs a bitwise OR operation on two values.
- Bitwise XOR: Performs a bitwise XOR operation on two values.
- Bitwise NOT: Performs a bitwise NOT operation on a value.
- Left Shift: Shifts the bits of a value to the left.
- Right Shift: Shifts the bits of a value to the right.

This code provides a comprehensive overview of the various operators available in Python, along with examples and explanations to help you understand how to use them effectively.
